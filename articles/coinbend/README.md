When I first created my decentralized exchange I wrote a whitepaper that introduced several new concepts.

* Green addresses (a way to do blockchain key management with high security -- https://keys.casa uses the same technique.)
* Crypto-asset trading with minimal trust and only standard transactions (using micro-payment channels)
* Time-locked refunds without nLockTime (using https://roberts.pm/timechain)
* Peer-to-peer networking (using https://github.com/StorjOld/pyp2p)
* A (broken) decentralized order book
